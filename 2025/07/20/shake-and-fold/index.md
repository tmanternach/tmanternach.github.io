My [bookmarking service](https://bookmarks.trevormanternach.com/) tells me that I saved [this video](https://www.ted.com/talks/joe_smith_how_to_use_a_paper_towel) in April 2016. I'm not joking one bit when I tell you that I have thought of this video every single time I have washed my hands in a bathroom with paper towels. Give it a watch, it's a quick 4 minutes.

"You will, for the rest of your life, remember those words every time you pick up a paper towel."
