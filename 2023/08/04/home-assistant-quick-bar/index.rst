I discovered that `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/>`_ has a not-so-recent feature called "`Quick Bar <https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/tools/quick-bar/>`_" that I somehow missed when it was released in 2020. In short, it allows you to press the `e` (for entity search) or `c` (for command search) anywhere in the Home Assistant web interface to access a Spotlight-style search box. This allows you access settings and devices in Home Assistant with just a few keystrokes.
