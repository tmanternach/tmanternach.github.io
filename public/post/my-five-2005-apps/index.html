      <p><em>Inspired by <a href="https://512pixels.net/2025/12/five-apps-i-used-in-2005/">this post</a>.</em></p>
<p>I was a sophomore in high school in 2005; just a couple of years into my hobby of technology. I wasn&rsquo;t yet an Apple user (or even Linux, that would come in 2006), so my list of applications I was using 20 years ago is almost entirely Windows-based.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Messenger">Yahoo Messenger</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger">MSN Messenger</a></strong>: I&rsquo;m putting these together. My hometown was very evenly split between Yahoo and MSN for instant messenging. I believe I had tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillian_(software)">Trillian</a> by 2005, but went back to the native applications because of the emoji-style features they had released that only worked in the native applications. Instant messenging was a huge part of my early computing life, and I feel like so much of that is lost these days where you can reach anybody at anytime of day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a></strong>: I don&rsquo;t know when I started using Firefox, but it was probably in 2004 or early 2005. Outside of a decade stint starting in 2008 with Chrome, I&rsquo;ve been a daily Firefox user for my entire computing life. It&rsquo;s the best browser for me; it works like I expect a browser to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa">Picasa</a></strong>: I had a Canon digital camera and was in love with Picasa. My memory is it wasn&rsquo;t a Google application at first; Google acquired them, but I don&rsquo;t think I ever used Picasa before Google bought it. The face-grouping features it had back then felt like a magic trick, and I loved that it kept originals untouched on your filesystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes">iTunes</a></strong>: I bought my first iPod in 2004 and was pretty quickly converted to an Apple fanboy. I remember running some free podcast catcher (&ldquo;podcatcher&rdquo; we used to say!), I think it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_%28aggregator%29">iPodder</a>. I have a <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/trvr3307/22113658/">screenshot on my Flickr page</a> from June 2005 when iTunes was updated to support Podcasts. I can remember those days like it was yesterday, scrolling through the Podcast Directory and finding some gems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_(software)">XBMC</a></strong>: This is the only non-Windows program, but it has to be my favorite. I used a software-mod to modify my original Xbox; this had to be have been sometime in 2005. I have <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/trvr3307/81278576/">another picture on my Flickr</a> that shows me watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggnation">Diggnation</a> on XBMC on our 52&quot; rear-projection TV. XBMC was pretty life-changing for me, to be honest. It taught me a bunch about file sharing and FTP and video codecs, knowledge I still have and use today.</p>
