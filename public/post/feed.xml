      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://512pixels.net/2025/12/five-apps-i-used-in-2005/&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a sophomore in high school in 2005; just a couple of years into my hobby of technology. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet an Apple user (or even Linux, that would come in 2006), so my list of applications I was using 20 years ago is almost entirely Windows-based.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was a sophomore in high school in 2005; just a couple of years into my hobby of technology. I wasn&#39;t yet an Apple user (or even Linux, that would come in 2006), so my list of applications I was using 20 years ago is almost entirely Windows-based.

&lt;!--more--&gt;
  1. **[Yahoo Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Messenger) / [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger)**: I&#39;m putting these together. My hometown was very evenly split between Yahoo and MSN for instant messenging. I believe I had tried [Trillian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillian_(software)) by 2005, but went back to the native applications because of the emoji-style features they had released that only worked in the native applications. Instant messenging was a huge part of my early computing life, and I feel like so much of that is lost these days where you can reach anybody at anytime of day.
  
  2. **[Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)**: I don&#39;t know when I started using Firefox, but it was probably in 2004 or early 2005. Outside of a decade stint starting in 2008 with Chrome, I&#39;ve been a daily Firefox user for my entire computing life. It&#39;s the best browser for me; it works like I expect a browser to work.

  4. **[iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes)**: I bought my first iPod in 2004 and was pretty quickly converted to an Apple fanboy.
