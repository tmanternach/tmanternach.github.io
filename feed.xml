I just signed up this week ($5/month for 3 months) and it’s been a delight so far. I discovered that you can pretty easily remove the DRM on the audiobook .aax file. I am using &lt;a href="https://audible-converter.ml/"&gt;Audible Tools&lt;/a&gt; to help me create the ffmpeg command to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recent discovery is that &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/"&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt;, my podcast player of choice, seems to natively support .m4b files (audiobook file format). It even includes artwork and chapters, so it behaves just like most of the podcasts I listen to.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://trevormanternach.com/2022/11/25/audiobooks.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:39:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>1997 Photo at computer</title><link>https://trevormanternach.com/2022/08/18/the-earliest-photo.html</link><dc:creator>Trevor Manternach</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;The earliest photo I have of me at a computer.

I thought it might be fun to document my history with the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my first iPod in March 2005. I believe I bought mine at Best Buy on a weekend trip 350 miles away from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://trevormanternach.com/images/4th-Gen-iPod.jpg" width="600" alt="Picture of my first iPod"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a lot of podcasts in those early days and had to use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_(aggregator)"&gt;"podcatcher" software&lt;/a&gt; because iTunes didn't support podcasts yet. That changed later that year when &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_iTunes#iTunes_4"&gt;iTunes 4.9&lt;/a&gt; added podcasts and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I visited that same Best Buy a couple years later when the iPod Touch was released. I remember checking their website and they said they had them in stock, but when I got to the store I couldn't find them. I finally asked and they were still in the back, they went and got one for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://trevormanternach.com/images/iPod-Touch.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="My first iPod Touch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPod Touch was so much fun back then. The iPhone wasn't "in" Montana back then (no joke) and so the Touch was as close as I could get. I remember jailbreaking the thing, and even hanging out in IRC chatrooms trying to troubleshoot my jailbreak attempts. :-D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past winter I spent ~$100 on new parts to revive my old 4th gen iPod. It now has new life with &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPod/iPod-4G-Photo-Battery/IF193-016?o=3"&gt;a fresh battery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-solo/"&gt;an SD card&lt;/a&gt; in place of the 20GB spinning hard drive. It's hard to believe a piece of consumer technology from 17 years ago is still alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love iPod. It was one of my first adventures into a lifetime of technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://trevormanternach.com/2022/06/04/my-ipod-history.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2022 13:41:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>AdGuard Wildcard DNS with Nginx Proxy Manager</title><link>https://trevormanternach.com/2022/04/30/adguard-wildcard-dns-with-nginx-proxy-manager.html</link><dc:creator>Trevor Manternach</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I started using Nginx Proxy Manger at home recently and found a fast and easy way to add internal domains to it. Here is a simple walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to be using &lt;a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html"&gt;AdGuard Home&lt;/a&gt; for DNS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to quickly add new domains to &lt;a href="https://nginxproxymanager.com/"&gt;Nginx Proxy Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;AdGuard Home setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the AdGuard Home web interface, go to Filters-&amp;gt;DNS rewrites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of DNS rewrite options on AdGuard Home" src="https://trevormanternach.com/images/adguard-1.png" title="Screenshot of DNS rewrite options on AdGuard Home"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Add DNS rewrite&lt;/strong&gt; and enter something like &lt;em&gt;*.home&lt;/em&gt; in the domain name field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the IP address of your NPM host and click &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nginx Proxy Manager&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Nginx Proxy Manager" src="https://trevormanternach.com/images/nginx-1.png" title="Screenshot of Nginx Proxy Manager"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really isn't anything special to do in NPM. Just add a Proxy Host and in the domain names field you can enter anything as long as it ends in .home (or whatever you chose for a wildcard). www.home even works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another little feature I discovered while setting this up is that I can add multiple domain names for each proxy host. So &lt;em&gt;adguard.home&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dns.home&lt;/em&gt; can both get me to the same place. This helps when I can't remember the name of a service, or when you change software you can keep using something like &lt;em&gt;dashboard.home&lt;/em&gt; for your &lt;a href="https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer"&gt;dashboard of choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>adguard</category><category>dns</category><category>tutorial</category><guid>https://trevormanternach.com/2022/04/30/adguard-wildcard-dns-with-nginx-proxy-manager.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 02:59:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>2020 Books I've Read</title><link>https://trevormanternach.com/2020/books-ive-read/</link><dc:creator>Trevor Manternach</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538641-killing-kennedy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jukebox" src="https://trevormanternach.com/images/ok-google-play-music-on-the-jukebox/jukebox.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently picked up an AMI R-89 jukebox. It is a combo unit, plays both 45 rpm records and CDs. It looked to be in full working order, was full of music, and only $400. I have always wanted a jukebox, but I also wanted to be able to easily play any music through it. I’ve found a way, and it feels like the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CD Player&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to play CDs, the jukebox comes with a Philips 6-disc CD player. It has RCA audio outputs, and also has a few control wires so the jukebox controller board can tell the player which track to play. My first attempt to play my own music was just to put my own CDs in the player, but (I think) because the CD player had not been used for a long time, it was constantly skipping and freezing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Headphone to RCA&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unplugged the RCA outputs from the CD player, and hooked up a 3.5MM headphone to RCA cable. This let me then plug my iPhone in and try to play music through it. It worked, with one major caveat: the amplifier is muted unless it is told by the jukebox that 1) a record is playing or 2) a CD is playing. Because neither of those things were happening, no sound comes through the speakers. This is easy to get around, temporarily, by just telling the jukebox to play a CD track. This only works until that song is over, then the amplifier mutes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wiring Diagrams and Cutting the Orange Wire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By complete luck, the jukebox came with a 3-ring binder full of manuals. Inside one of the books is a step-by-step breakdown of what happens inside the jukebox when a selection is made. Following this, I found that the amplifier is constantly being sent a mute signal on one wire. When a song is playing, there is no signal sent through that wire. That then tells the amplifier to un-mute so we can hear the song. This seemed almost backwards to me, but it’s actually perfect. All I needed to do was cut that mute wire, and the amplifier is then always un-muted. This isn’t perfect, there is a slight hum when nothing is playing, but I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Worked Great for 20 Minutes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above setup was awesome, until 20 minutes in when the jukebox would automatically choose a record to play. It has an “Autoplay” setting, and after 20 minutes of inactivity (because the jukebox has no idea that the iPhone is playing music) it will choose a song at random. Fortunately, again using the manuals, I found a Programming Guide that allowed me to completely disable the Autoplay feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chromecast Audio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chromecast Audio" src="https://trevormanternach.com/images/ok-google-play-music-on-the-jukebox/chromecast-audio.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone worked well, but any time a text message or phone call would come in, the music would pause. It also just looked ugly, either the jukebox needed to be open or the iPhone shoved inside to work. I decided to pick up a Google Chromecast Audio. We have a couple of regular Chromecasts in the house, but didn’t have any of the audio-only versions. It plugs into power inside the jukebox, where the CD player used to go. This means that the jukebox still only has 1 power cord coming out of it. The Chromecast Audio uses WiFi, so it was extremely easy to set up. I named it “Jukebox” and could then stream Spotify from my iPhone to it. This was much easier than needing to leave my phone inside the jukebox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;"Ok, Google"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Google home" src="https://trevormanternach.com/images/ok-google-play-music-on-the-jukebox/google-home.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received a Google Home for Christmas, and it tied this project up into the perfect bow. Because the Home has built-in Google Cast support, I can simply say “Ok, Google, play music on the jukebox” and a few seconds later the jukebox starts playing music. The cool part about the Google Cast/Home ecosystem is that
they don’t lock you into their music provider. I was able to connect my Home to my Spotify Premium account, and the Home then knows to use it for music. You don’t have to say “Play music from Spotify”, just “Play music”. It feels very natural. The other benefit is that you can do all of this from your phone or computer, Spotify has great Google Cast support. The Google Home “hands-free” part is just icing on the cake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next Step, Maybe&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Samsung Smartthings" src="https://trevormanternach.com/images/ok-google-play-music-on-the-jukebox/smartthings.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell how much I actually use this, but the next step might be to look into plugging the jukebox into one of these new “smart” power plugs. Google Home supports the SmartThings Hub from Samsung, and then I would be able to turn on the jukebox, wait a few seconds for the Chromecast to boot up, and then have it play music, all hands-free. But for now, this current setup is perfect for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Outro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was such a fun (and easy) project. Like I said, I have wanted a jukebox for a long time, and I love that this still looks and works like a normal jukebox (45s still play just fine!) while being able to instantly stream almost any song to it.&lt;/p&gt;
