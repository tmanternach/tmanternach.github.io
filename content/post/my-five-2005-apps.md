*Inspired by [this post](https://512pixels.net/2025/12/five-apps-i-used-in-2005/).*

I was a sophomore in high school in 2005; just a couple of years into my hobby of technology. I wasn't yet an Apple user (or even Linux, that would come in 2006), so my list of applications I was using 20 years ago is almost entirely Windows-based.

  1. **[Yahoo Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Messenger) / [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger)**: I'm putting these together. My hometown was very evenly split between Yahoo and MSN for instant messenging. I believe I had tried [Trillian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillian_(software)) by 2005, but went back to the native applications because of the emoji-style features they had released that only worked in the native applications. Instant messenging was a huge part of my early computing life, and I feel like so much of that is lost these days where you can reach anybody at anytime of day.
  
  2. **[Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox)**: I don't know when I started using Firefox, but it was probably in 2004 or early 2005. Outside of a decade stint starting in 2008 with Chrome, I've been a daily Firefox user for my entire computing life. It's the best browser for me; it works like I expect a browser to work.
  
  3. **[Picasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa)**: I had a Canon digital camera and was in love with Picasa. My memory is it wasn't a Google application at first; Google acquired them, but I don't think I ever used Picasa before Google bought it. The face-grouping features it had back then felt like a magic trick, and I loved that it kept originals untouched on your filesystem.
  
  4. **[iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes)**: I bought my first iPod in 2004 and was pretty quickly converted to an Apple fanboy. I remember running some free podcast catcher ("podcatcher" we used to say!), I think it was [iPodder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_%28aggregator%29). I have a [screenshot on my Flickr page](https://flickr.com/photos/trvr3307/22113658/) from June 2005 when iTunes was updated to support Podcasts. I can remember those days like it was yesterday, scrolling through the Podcast Directory and finding some gems.
  
  5. **[XBMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_(software))**: This is the only non-Windows program, but it has to be my favorite. I used a software-mod to modify my original Xbox; this had to be have been sometime in 2005. I have [another picture on my Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/trvr3307/81278576/) that shows me watching [Diggnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggnation) on XBMC on our 52" rear-projection TV. XBMC was pretty life-changing for me, to be honest. It taught me a bunch about file sharing and FTP and video codecs, knowledge I still have and use today.
