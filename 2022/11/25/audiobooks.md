It’s been years since I last paid for an Audible.com subscription. I just signed up this week ($5/month for 3 months) and it’s been a delight so far. I discovered that you can pretty easily remove the DRM on the audiobook .aax file. I am using [Audible Tools](https://audible-converter.ml/) to help me create the ffmpeg command to do this.

Another recent discovery is that [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/), my podcast player of choice, seems to natively support .m4b files (audiobook file format). It even includes artwork and chapters, so it behaves just like most of the podcasts I listen to.
