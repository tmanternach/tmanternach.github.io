        <p>Last month Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/05/the-music-lives-on/">announced</a> the end of the iPod. I thought it might be fun to document my history with the product.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I got my first iPod in March 2005. I believe I bought mine at Best Buy on a weekend trip 350 miles away from home.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/4th-Gen-iPod.jpg" width="600" alt="Picture of my first iPod"></p>
<p>I was listening to a lot of podcasts in those early days and had to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juice_(aggregator)">"podcatcher" software</a> because iTunes didn't support podcasts yet. That changed later that year when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_iTunes#iTunes_4">iTunes 4.9</a> added podcasts and the rest is history.</p>
<p>I visited that same Best Buy a couple years later when the iPod Touch was released. I remember checking their website and they said they had them in stock, but when I got to the store I couldn't find them. I finally asked and they were still in the back, they went and got one for me.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/iPod-Touch.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="My first iPod Touch"></p>
<p>The iPod Touch was so much fun back then. The iPhone wasn't "in" Montana back then (no joke) and so the Touch was as close as I could get. I remember jailbreaking the thing, and even hanging out in IRC chatrooms trying to troubleshoot my jailbreak attempts. :-D</p>
<p>This past winter I spent ~$100 on new parts to revive my old 4th gen iPod. It now has new life with <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPod/iPod-4G-Photo-Battery/IF193-016?o=3">a fresh battery</a> and <a href="https://www.iflash.xyz/store/iflash-solo/">an SD card</a> in place of the 20GB spinning hard drive. It's hard to believe a piece of consumer technology from 17 years ago is still alive and well.</p>
<p>I love iPod. It was one of my first adventures into a lifetime of technology.</p>
